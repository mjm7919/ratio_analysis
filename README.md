calculating capillary diameter using ratio analysis of flux in pixel intensities

script reads images from movie and find raw capillary space.  morphological transformations smooth the boundaries of the space.  medial axis transform finds diameter.  Issues that arise are capillary regions merge together because of bloating.  must address!!
